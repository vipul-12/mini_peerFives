## Starting the Project

In the project directory, you'll see two folders, client and server. Open up terminals in both of them. Run the following commands in both of these terminals.


1) ### `npm install`
This will install all the necessary dependancies.

2) ### `npm start` in case of client and `nodemon` in the case of server

Runs the react app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Runs the express server on port 8080.

## Dependancies/Libraries Used:

1) `styled-components`
For styling the app.

2) `axios`
For api requests. 

3) `sqlite3`
For interacting with the sqlite3 database.

4) `cors`
For enabling cors.

5) `nodemon`
To keep a persistent express server running.

## Percentage Completion

I was not able to display and delete the transactions :(.
